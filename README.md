Problem Statement: Virtual Traffic Light - The software will advise users on which link is the best one to click. Every link that arrives in the phone, whether it be by SMS, email, or instant message, will be taken into account. The app will light up in three distinct colours, including Red, Orange, and Green, in order to keep track of past harmful behaviour and reports filed thus far.
